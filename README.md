# Wine Classification Project

Welcome to the Wine Classification project repository! This project utilizes the wine dataset from `sklearn.datasets` to classify wines into three categories. The dataset is loaded, split into training and testing sets, and two classifiers‚ÄîGaussian and Multinomial‚Äîare trained to determine which model performs better. The trained model is then used to make predictions on the test data.

## Project Overview

### Dataset

- **Wine Dataset:**
  - The dataset used for this project is sourced from `sklearn.datasets`.
  - It includes various features related to wine characteristics.

### Data Splitting

- **Train-Test Split:**
  - The dataset is split into training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

### Model Training

- **Gaussian and Multinomial Classifiers:**
  - Two classifiers, Gaussian and Multinomial, are trained on the dataset.
  - Gaussian classifier is suitable for continuous data, while Multinomial is suited for discrete features.

### Model Comparison

- **Performance Evaluation:**
  - The performance of both classifiers is evaluated.
  - Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are considered to determine which model performs better.

### Predictions on Test Data

- **Model Testing:**
  - The trained model with better performance is utilized to make predictions on the test data.
  - Insights into the accuracy and reliability of the chosen classifier are obtained.

## Project Execution

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-classification.git
   cd wine-classification
   ```

2. **Run the Project:**
   - Execute the Jupyter Notebook (`wine_classification.ipynb`) in your preferred environment.

3. **Follow Notebook Instructions:**
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, split it, train classifiers, and evaluate model performance.

4. **Make Predictions:**
   - Utilize the trained classifier with better performance to make predictions on the test data.

## Note

This Wine Classification project showcases the use of two classifiers, Gaussian and Multinomial, to classify wines into three categories based on their features. Model performance is rigorously evaluated to choose the most effective classifier for making predictions.

Feel free to explore, modify, and utilize this project for wine classification. If you have any questions or suggestions, please create an issue in the repository.
